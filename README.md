#Test Automation Framework
### This project should contains 3 modules:
* UI - for UI tests,
* REST - for rest tests,
* Commons - for utils which will be used in both - UI and REST module.

#### UI module
This module should let you write and run tests on UI.

I want to use:

#### REST module
This module should let you write and run tests for REST endpoints of your application.

I want to use:
* RestAssured,
* TestNG,

#### Commons module
This module should contains tools which will be used in both - UI and REST modules.
Tools like property file reader or password encoder.
